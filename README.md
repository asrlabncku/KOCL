# KOCL-Augmenting Operating Systems with OpenCL Accelerators

KOCL is a general purpose framework for accelerating the kernel software with OpenCL accelerators,
which is built by migrating the KGPU code to the OpenCL platforms.We further added the zero-copy 
scheme and the support of multiple devices for concurrent processing in KOCL to take advantage of the OpenCL standard.
